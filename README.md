These are the scratch files and homework files I wrote during Udacity CS101 & CS373 Spring 2012. I didn't like doing it all in Python, so some of the files will be written in CoffeeScript/Node.js first.

Why am I taking both CS101 and CS373?
-------------------------------------

The answer is that I feel like I know programming and even Python (though I'm out of practice) enough, so I thought that CS101 would be easy. So far, CS101 is taking more time than I thought it would, but I wanted to follow the CS101 class to build the web crawler and search engine in that class. CS373 is interesting to me because it is mostly about probability and in general, self-driving cars are mobile robot. I've been passionate about mobile robotics since I was a kid.
